##INTRODUCTION##
I am writing this blog post about the course outcome called info201 provided by Department of Infomatics ,University of Washington. This class basically introduce basic R language and data to programming beginners and even those who do not have any programming skills.

##About the course##
R is a computer language that widely used in jobs related with Data-Science and Statistic, in this course,our professor, **Ott Toomet**, started the course step by step from the basic way of using github through the terminal to the calculations and then list to API and finally building apps. We did all the things step by step. 

##Why Should We Take the Course?##
If you don't have a good statistical background, you can choose the angle of data operation to learn R - this direction I feel that everyone is suitable, do not need academic or technical background, let alone the so-called financial background;
If you have the need for an algorithm or model analysis (or have a certain mathematical/programming background), then don't say anything, the algorithm and the model are definitely going to work (but learn more about how to implement your with R). Models and ideas). However, even in this case, the processing and mobilization of data is very practical and common in everyday life and should be mastered.
At this point, if you are still considering whether it is suitable for learning R language, it is better to give yourself some confidence: if you can use R to do a lot of data processing and basic analysis, this is a good skill in itself. After all, in financial institutions, not everyone needs to be a quant, basic work R can be fully competent, or even better - when your colleagues next to you are still suffering from a big data file turtle speed Excel, your The report has been completed.
